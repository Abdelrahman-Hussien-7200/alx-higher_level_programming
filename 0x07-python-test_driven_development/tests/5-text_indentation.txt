How to Use 5-text_indentation.py
================================

This module defines a text-indentation function ``text_indentation(text)``.


    >>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation
    >>> text_indentation("Abdo?")
    Abdo?
    <BLANKLINE>

No spaces are printed at the beginning of a line.

::

    >>> text_indentation("   Abdo a.")
    Abdo a.
    <BLANKLINE>

::

    >>> text_indentation("          ")

Similarly, no spaces are printed at the end of each printed line.

::

    >>> text_indentation("Abdo.   ")
    Abdo.
    <BLANKLINE>

::

    >>> text_indentation("   king is .    back home.   ")
    king is.
    <BLANKLINE>
    back home.
    <BLANKLINE>

New lines are only printed for the characters ``.``, ``?``, and ``:`` -

::

    >>> text_indentation("Abdo is the king, you are the people")
    Abdo is the king, you are the people

New lines within a string are printed as normal.

::

    >>> text_indentation({"3, 4})
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text must be a string

::

    >>> text_indentation(None)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text must be a string
